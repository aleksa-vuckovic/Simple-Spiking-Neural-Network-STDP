# A simple Implementation of an SNN
This is a simple from scratch implementation of a Spiking-Neural-Network with STDP in Python. We created this repository as part of our Neurodynamics lecture at the Osnabr√ºck University. If you are interested in a more detailed description, you can read our term paper, which we also uploaded as "Paper.pdf".
